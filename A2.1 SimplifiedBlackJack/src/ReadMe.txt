Iadded code to the method playBlackJack() for this task. 
The goal is to get as close as possible to 21 points. If the user exceeds 21 points, he lost.
The card and the current score are displayed. 
• Aces are worth eleven points. 
• twos to tens count according to their card rank. 
• jacks, queens, kings count ten points. 
If 21 points have been exceeded, the System prints LOST.

As the name implies, this version of Black Jack is SIMPLIFIED.
