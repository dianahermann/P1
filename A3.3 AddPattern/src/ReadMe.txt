First of all: In the following array representation, the first dimension is shown as Y-axis and the second dimension is 
shown as X-axis (it's reversed). The array starts at the top left, [0][0].
The program loops through an array (given as parameter long[][]) with the pattern below:
 
␣ X X 
X ␣ ␣ X 
X ␣ ␣ X 
␣ X X 

The program adds up all the parameters passed, matching the pattern. Only the fields with the X are relevant.
The sum resulting from the addition is the result.
